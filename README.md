# pycon-ke

## Figuring out if a number is prime or not;
## Checking to see if a number is in the fibonacci series.


This is a lightweight project to test on python control flow, logical thinking and a general test on python basics.

It has two relevant files:
* prime_number
* fibonacci_number

Run either on your preferred environment to see how it works
